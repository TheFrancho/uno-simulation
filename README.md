# uno-simulation
Uno card game simulation for checking hands chances.

You can find the full explanation of the code (only spanish) [here](https://www.notion.so/Simulaciones-de-Montecarlo-Calculando-tu-suerte-en-el-Uno-con-Python-7af682bc8e6d4be9a463e6c52c373d18).

Based on the original 108 cards, this program simulates the chances of getting a specific hand such as:
- Getting at least a +4 in your initial hand.
- Getting only wildcards in your hand (+4 and change colour).
- Getting no wildcards in your hand.
- Getting all your cards of the same colour.
- Getting all the +4 wildcards in a single draw.

The hand sizes and the amount of tries are customizable, so feel free to play with my code.
